# mnist-learntree
A small machine learning project coded in Java.
The algorithm builds a decision tree of an MNIST database (could be any other .csv database).
In each diversion of the tree, there is a greedy algorithm which finds the best <L,X> where L is a leaf and X is a diversion-condition,
to maximize the information-gain in that specific diversion.
